#+title:    Doom Emacs - Community Modules
#+subtitle: The repository for user-contributed modules

In the future, this repository will hold Doom's community-maintained module
library (an optional extension to [[https://git.doomemacs.org/modules][Doom's official one]]). It won't be as carefully
curated or supported, but will accept a wider range of functionality. Users will
be able to pull it in from their ~doom!~ blocks.

For now, it is simply a placeholder.
